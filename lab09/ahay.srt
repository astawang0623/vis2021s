Ahay -  by Of Monsters and Men

1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,500
I know that I'm wrong

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,100
And now we're both sitting in silence

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,800
But if it's alright

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,300
I'll wrap myself around your cold shoulder

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,400
You think you know me

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,200
But do you really?

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,600
Something you do, something you say

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Oh, we don't talk about it

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,700
You think you know me

10
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,300
But do you really?

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,300
There's somethin' 'bout you

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,800
Somethin' 'bout you

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
(We don't talk about it)

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,400
A bull without horns

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,400
Said nothing, so how come I'm blushing?

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
And though you are warm

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:030,000
The cold lingers on the tip of your fingers

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,300
You think you know me

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,900
But do you really?

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
Something you do, something you say

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,600
Oh, we don't talk about it

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,600
You think you know me

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,400
But do you really?

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,400
There's somethin' 'bout you

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,800
Somethin' 'bout you

26
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Oh, you couldn't change this mountain

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,400
You've got me out chasing the sound but I just hear fractions

28
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,700
Oh, you couldn't change this mountain

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,200
You've got me out facing the sun but I just need direction

30
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,200
You think you know me

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,200
But do you really?

32
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,700
Something you do, something you say

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,600
Oh, we don't talk about it

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
You think you know me

35
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,400
But do you really? (Hey)

36
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,400
There's somethin' 'bout you

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
Somethin' 'bout you

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,600
(We don't talk about it)
